            <h2>2. Using Serums for Oily skin</h2> 
              <p>For oily skin, when it comes to searching for the suitable serum to match your skin it is important to pick one with the right ingredients. Serums made for oily skin should include ingredients such as Niacinamide, Salycylic acid and Vitamin C. The serums 
                in the image above are tested by dermatologist to be one of the best serums for oily skin. Niacinamide helps regulate the making of sebum which is excess oil your skin produces. It can also help with minimizing the appearance of pores and help with breakouts as when having oily skin, your skin is known to be acne prone. Salycylic acid is known to maintain pores and unclog them as well as reducing blackheads
                which is a common symptom of oily skin. Vitamin C is great at maintaining the excess amount of oil your skin produces when having oily skin and protects the skin of harsh environments as when dealing with this skin type, your skin tends to be very fragile and sensitive.

            <h2>3. Using a Moisturizer for Oily Skin</h4>
              <p> When it comes to using a moisturizer with oily skin, it is recommended to choose the lightweight option. A lightweight moisturizer is best used for oily skin as they are less likely to clog pores. When your pores are clogged, it is more likely for breakouts to occur when pores are blocked. A normal moisturizer could
                create a thick layer on your skin which could trap the oil produced from your skin and cause more skin concerns. When you use a lightweight moisturizer it is absorbed into the skin faster and will not leave a shiny cast on your skin. A lightweight moisturizer will give the skin just the right amount of hydration it needs without adding unnecessary oils into the skin whereas, normal moisturizers will make the skin produce even more oiliness your skin does not need. The moisturizers shown above are all
                great lightweight options of moisturizers for oily skin.

            <h2>4. Using Sunscreen for Oily Skin</h2>
            <p>No matter what skin type you have, it is always important to include a sunscreen in your routine as it protects your skin from the harmful effect of the sun. 
              The UV rays from the sun can cause skin concerns such as sunburn, premature aging, and the risk of skin cancer. Sunscreen will protect you of these harmful effects of the sun and should be used no matter what skin type you are. The sunscreens in the image above
              are specifically made for oily skin as they are "non-comedogenic". This means that sunscreens with this ingredient will not clog pores, this is great for acne-prone skin such as oily skin.
              These sunscreens above are also fragrance free, products with fragrance irritates the skin and can cause skin reactions such as breakouts. Non-fragranced sunscreens are better as they will not irritate the skin because oily skin tends to be sensitive.
              Lightweight sunscreens should also be used for oily skin as it absorbs fast into the skin and will not give a greasy residue in the skin making it more greasy than it already is. Ensure to always use a sunscreen everyday only in the mornings, to provide you protection from the sun for the day.</p>
