    <h1>How to look after dry skin when it comes to a skincare routine</h1>
    <h2>How do you know if you have dry skin?</h2>
<p>It is completely normal to have dry skin and usually occurs when your skin produces less naturals oils than anyone elses. If you think you have  dry skin 
  some common ways to confirm this is if your skin feels rough and sudden itchiness occurs frequently around your face. If you have severe dry skin your skin could begin flaking and this just means you have to 
  add more hydration into your skin. Ways you could improve dry skin could be applying moisturizer after washing and if you are struggiling with servere dry skin using an ointment 
  rather than a lotion could work better than a moisturizer as they are more effective and prevents irritation on the skin from occuring.

            <h2>1. Choosing the right cleanser for dry skin</h2>
            <p>The first step to a skincare routine is starting off with a cleanser as it is used to remove dirt, and impurities from the skin. For people with dry skin it's best to avoid foaming cleansers because they remove all the small amounts of oil your face 
           produces from your pores, making your skin drier than it already is.The best cleansers for dry skin are cream cleansers or gentle cleansers that won't strip away your skins natural moisture. 
           Choosing a gentle hydrating cleanser is also a great option because it restores the moisture your skin needs without stripping it away. A gentle cleanser will make your skin feel soft after washing and hydrated. When it comes to cleansing your face especially with dry skin 
           I recommend a gentle hydrating cleanser. </p>

            <h2>2. Using Toner in a Skincare routine for dry skin</h2> 
            <p>Using a toner in a skincare routine acts 
            as a hydrating formula and removes any traces of dirt from your skin adter washing your face and should be used after cleanser. which is what your skins needs when it's dry. When your skin is dry it needs as much hydration as it can get to restore it's natural moisture without damaging it.
            When choosing the right toner it is best to choose one that has hylauronic acid in it because it fills your skin with the most moisture. Toners with alcohol are the worst for dry skin because they will make your skin even drier than it already is which is definitely not what it needs.
      Toners are optional but are definitely recommended for dry skin because they act as hydrators and balances the hydration in your skin.</p>

            <h2>2. Using Serums in a Skincare routine for dry skin</h2> 
              <p>A serum should be used as the thrid step of your skincare routine. It is important for dry skin as it provides intense moisture which gives the skin the hydration it needs. The best serums for dry skin
                are hylauronic acid as it plumps, smooths and is known to be one of the most hydrating serums for dry skin. Serums such as hylauronic acid can be used everyday, morning and night to provide as must hydration and moisture your skin needs. 
              When you have dry skin your skin may feel rough, flake and itch which is why a serum will stop the irritation in your skin along with the rest of your hydrating products for extra hydration.

            <h2>3. Using a Moisturizer in a Skincare routine for dry skin</h4>
                <p> When it comes to a moisturizer it is crucial to include it into your skincare routine as similar to a serum, it is one of the products that gives your skin the maximum hydration and moisture. A moisturizer infuzes the skin with moisture and restores it's protective barrier which can help with flaky skin, tightness and irritation. 
                  A moisturizer provides moisture and protects your skin barrier from environment conditions which tend to dry out your skin even more. A moisturizer and your other skincare products used together in a routine will do wonders for your dry skin and repair it from the damage caused from dry skin. </p>

            <h2>4. Using Sunscreen for dry skin</h2>
            <p>Sunscreen should be used for all skin types but when it comes to dry skin, it's best to choose a specific type of sunscreen which will work better for your skin. All sunscreens will give you protection from the UV rays of the sun, being protected from the sun is important as it prevents skin concerns such as sunburns, breakouts, premature aging and can increase the skin of skin cancer.
              For dry skin, the best type of sunscreens to use are ones that include hylauronic acid and glycerin which are well known for providing deep hydration into the skin, which is what your dry skin needs as weel as providing protection from the sun. The sunscreens shown in the images above are amazing for dry skin as they provide many antioxidents which are hydrating factors for the skin. These sunscreens are especially made for all skin types but also works amazing on dry skin as they offer high sun protection and moisture into the skin.
              When choosing a sunscreen for dry skin, it is best to look for one which includes the words "hydrating", "moisturizing" or "for dry skin". Ensure to always use a sunscreen only in the mornings to protect your skin of the sun during the day.
